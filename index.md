The Matrix: connecting and re-using digital records and archives of archaeological investigations

This project will investigate how digital data from archaeological excavations can be made more useful and beneficial to a range of users and audiences. It will produce a plan and methods to get such data more consistently recorded, analysed, disseminated and archived in a way that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-useable (FAIR).

The Matrix project will address current problems caused by the lack of standardized approaches to digital archiving of such archaeological data using the particular case study of stratigraphic and phasing data. Stratigraphic data form the backbone of all the related archaeological records from each excavated site and are essential for integrated analysis, wider synthesis and accessible archiving of the growing body of archaeological data and reports generated through the commercially funded archaeological sector as well as academic research in the UK and internationally.
